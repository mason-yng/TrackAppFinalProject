There are eight .java files each containing the code for each activity XML. There are 10 .XML files. 
There are buttons to move between each and every screen and an instructions screen to further offer help. The layout is very user friendly and easy to see. 
Currently in its beta stages. The proposal indicated that there will be bonus features and more tracking features as the app is further developed. It has its base features of tracking and needs however an issue is that the information is not retained properly. Saving the information on the screen only lasts within the activity and not when the application is closed or when the activity is switched. You will get a clear example of this in the mood tracker. 

Most bugs have been dealt with through multiple tests however there are some that have not been completely dealt with.
Finance activity screen for calculating the 6 categories if all 6 categories aren't filled in with a number, the app crashes. 
If the weekly or monthly deduction buttons are pressed before any input is put in it also crashes. 

Mood, Finance and Calorie tracking for weekly purposes does not currently work fully as the information is lost after application is closed. However, the calculators provided are functioning.
